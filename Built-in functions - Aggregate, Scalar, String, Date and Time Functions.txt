
--	Exercise 2

--	Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
SELECT sum(cost) from petrescue;

-- Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
SELECT sum(cost) as SUM_OF_COST from petrescue;

--	Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
SELECT max(quantity) from petrescue;

--	Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
SELECT avg(cost) from petrescue;

--	Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog. Hint - Bear in my the cost of rescuing one dog on day, is different from another day. So you will have to use and average of averages.
--SELECT avg(cost) from petrescue
--where animal = 'Dog';
select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE
where ANIMAL = 'Dog';

--	Exercise 3

--	Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
SELECT round(cost) from petrescue;

--	Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
SELECT length(animal) from petrescue;

--	Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
SELECT UCASE(animal) from petrescue;

--	Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
SELECT distinct(UCASE(animal)) from petrescue;

--	Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
SELECT * from petrescue
where LCASE(animal)='cat';


--	Exercise 4

--	Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
select DAY(rescuedate) from petrescue
where LCASE(animal)='cat';

--	Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
--select count(*) from petrescue
--where DAY(rescuedate) = 5;

select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE
where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)='05';

--	Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
--select count(*) from petrescue
--where DAY(rescuedate) = 14;

select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE
where DAY(RESCUEDATE)=14;

--	Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
select DAY(rescuedate + 3 DAYS) from petrescue;

--	Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the recue date.
